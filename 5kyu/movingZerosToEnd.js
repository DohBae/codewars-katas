/*
Write an algorithm that takes an array and moves all of the zeros to the end, preserving the order of the other elements.

EXAMPLE:
moveZeros([false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"]) // returns[false,1,1,2,1,3,"a",0,0]
*/

function moveZeros(arr) {
  // look through arr
  // check if element is a 0
  // if it is 0, move it to the end of the array
}

moveZeros([false,1,0,1,2,0,1,3,"a"])
